# Help desk ticketing system under development

## Intro
I love sharing a good experience! As I'm developing an [awesome help desk ticketing system](https://github.com/bigabdoul/helpdeskcore) for one of the United Nations' agency, I decided to put the code as an open-source project here on Github so that my peer programmers may tap into it and contribute to its growth. If you're a passionate developer like me with interest in C#, ASP.NET Core, SignalR, Angular 5, Web/REST API, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, and the like, don't hesitate to join the project and become an active contributor.

## Brief description

The Help Desk Core system has features like instant notifications, e-mail notifications, event logging, issues, users, and categories management. Many great features are planned for the near future, such as pulling e-mails from a predefined account and create tickets automatically upon receiving e-mails through that account.

## How can you help?

Your help is much appreciated in areas such as: 

* internationalization using [Angular's internationalization guidelines](https://angular.io/guide/i18n);
* setup an incoming e-mail handler that periodically checks for new e-mails and generates tickets from them;
* send e-mail notifications to other users mentioned through their e-mail addresses;
* implement a change user password form;
* generate reports;
* so much more...

This document is an ongoing work and will be updated to include the [full specifications of planned and desired features](/bigabdoul/helpdeskcore/blob/master/features.md) of the application.

Big things come in small packages. Let's build together something really helpful!
