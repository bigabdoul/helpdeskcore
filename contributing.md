# Help desk ticketing system under development on Github

I love sharing a good experience! As I'm developing an [awesome help desk ticketing system](https://github.com/bigabdoul/helpdeskcore) for one of the United Nations' agency, I decided to put the code as an open-source project on Github (https://github.com/bigabdoul/helpdeskcore) so that my peer programmers may tap into it and contribute to its growth. If you're a passionate developer like me with interest in C#, ASP.NET Core, SignalR, Angular 5, Web/REST API, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, and the like, don't hesitate to join the project and become an active contributor.

The Help Desk Core system has features like instant notifications, e-mail notifications, event logging, issues, users, and categories management. Many great features are planned for the near future, such as pulling e-mails from a predefined account and create tickets automatically upon receiving e-mails through that account.

Your help is much appreciated in areas such as: 

* internationalization using Angular's internationalization guidelines;
* setup an incoming e-mail handler that periodically checks for new e-mails and generates tickets from them;
* send e-mail notifications to other users mentioned through their e-mail addresses;
* so much more...

This document is an ongoing work and will be updated to include the full specifications of planned and desired features of the application.

Big things come in small packages. Let's build together something really helpful!
